# Pizza Hunt

Module 18 Lesson Activity - NoSQL

## About

In this module, I built Pizza Hunt, a social media recipe app where users can post their creative spins on pizza, add comments to recipes, and create threads within comments. To do this, I added back-end functionality to an existing front end.

Instead of using a MySQL database, I used MongoDB, a document-based NoSQL database, and Mongoose, an Object-Document Mapper, to work with unstructured data.

**Update: Due to the removal of Heroku's free product plans, I have found another free hosting platform that was not taught in the bootcamp. The [Heroku link](https://cryptic-harbor-15816.herokuapp.com/) for this site no longer works. Please view this site with the new link above. Thanks!**
