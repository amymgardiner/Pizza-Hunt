# Pizza Hunt

Module 18 Lesson Activity - NoSQL

## About

In this module, I built Pizza Hunt, a social media recipe app where users can post their creative spins on pizza, add comments to recipes, and create threads within comments. To do this, I added back-end functionality to an existing front end.

Instead of using a MySQL database, I used MongoDB, a document-based NoSQL database, and Mongoose, an Object-Document Mapper, to work with unstructured data.

**Update: Due to the removal of Heroku's free product plans, I have found another free hosting platform that was not taught in the bootcamp. The [Heroku link](https://cryptic-harbor-15816.herokuapp.com/) for this site no longer works. Please view this site with the new link below. Thanks!**

## Where to View

`Note: I use Render now for hosting my school projects, on their free plan. A free plan will spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity, and the next request will spin it back up, which can take awhile. So please be patient as the site may take some time to initially load due to Render restrictions.`
